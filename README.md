# asw2json

Utility to write a JSON file using .cpp .h files generated by  https://github.com/manicken/SoundFontDecoder.git.

This repository is part of a project to serialise SoundFont 2 data from the Teensy Audio AudioSynthWavetable::instrument_data structure to a JSON format that can be stored in a file. There are two companion repositories https://github.com/rogerjames99/json2asw-platformio.git and https://github.com/rogerjames99/json2asw-arduino.git. These contain implementations implementations of a complementary json2asw library and an example of usage for the platformio and arduino IDE platforms respectively.

## Workflow
1. Run the script rewrite-instrument contained in the tools subdirectory. It takes a single parameter which is the name of the soundfont file to process minus the .sf2 extension. For example "./rewrite-instrument irish2".
2. Run the json2asw executable. This will produce a json file called instrument.jso
3. Copy the file to a micro sd card for the teensy, rename it to something sensible.
4. The examples subdirectory contains a sketch to play a note from a json file soundfont loaded from disc.
